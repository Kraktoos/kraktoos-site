<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  I'm a Portuguese high school student and tech enthusiast currently studying at
  <a href="https://www.colgaia.pt">Col√©gio de Gaia</a> where I've been learning
  about general programming, OOP, databases, productivity apps and hardware.
</p>
<p>
  I'm into Tech, Programming, Linux, Free Software and Privacy and I'm currently
  learning about web development.

  In the past, I've worked on a few projects, mainly in C# (mainly for school),
  Python, JavaScript and some other languages here and there.
