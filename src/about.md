## About me

I'm a Portuguese high school student and tech enthusiast currently studying at [Col√©gio de Gaia](https://www.colgaia.pt) where I've been learning about general programming, OOP, databases, productivity apps and hardware.

I'm into Tech, Programming, Linux, Free Software and Privacy and I'm currently learning about web development.

In the past, I've worked on a few projects, mainly in C# (mainly for school), Python, JavaScript and some other languages here and there.
