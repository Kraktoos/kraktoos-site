With that being said, I do still use the occasional proprietary software, but I try to avoid it as much as possible.

# Software

### OS/Distro

I daily drive [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/). It's fast, stable, and I already have it installed, so why bother changing it?

However, when I **need** to use Microsoft tools like Access (for school), I **have** to use [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10).

### Window Manager

[i3wm](https://i3wm.org/). It's fast, simple, came pre-installed with Fedora, and serves all my basic needs.

### Web Browser

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) with the [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) user.js (a mixture of improvements to Firefox's privacy, security and speed (and some other QoL
things)). As per extensions, I use a **ton** of them, but the most notable ones are:

- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) to block ads, trackers and other annoyances (like cookie notices)
- [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) to get dark mode everywhere
- [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) as my [password manager](#password-manager)

### Text Editor

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), depending on the project.

### Terminal

[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) with [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/). At some point I might try [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/),
but as of now, I don't need it. I also use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) to keep terminal sessions and [powerline-shell](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell) to make my terminal look fancy.

## Utilities

### File Manager

[Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start) or [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) (if I want to look fancy). I don't really need anything too complex, I just have to be able to browse my files effectively.

### Video Player

[mpv](https://mpv.io/). You guessed it! It's free, open-source, fast, and I mean, it's mpv.

## Productivity

### Image Manipulation

[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/). Once again: It's free, open-source and has all the features I need.

### Video Editing

I haven't really been editing many videos but when I did, I used [VEGAS Pro](https://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/en/vegas-pro/) (on Windows) and more recently [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/), which works on Linux.

### Audio Editing

[Tenacity](https://tenacityaudio.org/) because Audacity started to ship with telemetry. It's free, open-source and has all the features I need.

### Office Suite

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) or [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/) (on Windows).

## Online Services

### Password Manager

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). It's free, open-source and, as of now (02/2023), trustworthy enough for me. I **have** used KeePass and other apps that support KeePass formats, and they're fine, but I
need to access my passwords outside my main devices.

### Email

[Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/). Not very feature rich, but it's really cheap, end-to-end encrypted, green and has its clients open-source.

### VPS

[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/). It's where I'm hosting this website, a Minecraft server, and others. They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.

### Domains

[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/). I've been using them for a while now and I've never had any issues with them. They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.

### DNS Management

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). I've been using them for a while now and I've never had any issues with them. They're cheap, reliable and have a great support team.
